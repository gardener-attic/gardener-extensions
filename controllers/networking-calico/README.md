# [Gardener Extension for Calico Networking](https://gardener.cloud)

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/gardener/gardener-extensions/controllers/networking-calico)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/gardener/gardener-extensions/controllers/networking-calico)

This controller operates on the [`Network`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/proposals/03-networking-extensibility.md#gardener-network-extension) resource in the `extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1` API group. It manages those objects that are requesting [Calico Networking](https://www.projectcalico.org/) configuration (`.spec.type=calico`):

```yaml
---
apiVersion: extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: calico-network
  namespace: shoot--core--test-01
spec:
  type: calico
  clusterCIDR: 192.168.0.0/24
  serviceCIDR:  10.96.0.0/24
  providerConfig:
    apiVersion: calico.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
    kind: NetworkConfig
    ipam:
      type: host-local
      cidr: usePodCIDR
    backend: bird
    typha:
      enabled: true
```

Please find [a concrete example](example/20-network.yaml) in the `example` folder. All the `Calico` specific configuration
should be configured in the `providerConfig` section. If additional configuration is required, it should be added to 
the `networking-calico` chart in `controllers/networking-calico/charts/internal/calico/values.yaml` and corresponding code
parts should be adapted (for example in `controllers/networking-calico/pkg/charts/utils.go`).

Once the network resource is applied, the `networking-calico` controller would then create all the necessary `managed-resources` which should be picked
up by the [gardener-resource-manager](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-resource-manager) which will then apply all the
network extensions resources to the shoot cluster. 

Finally after successful reconciliation an output similar to the one below should be expected.
```yaml
  status:
    lastOperation:
      description: Successfully reconciled network
      lastUpdateTime: "..."
      progress: 100
      state: Succeeded
      type: Reconcile
    observedGeneration: 1
    providerStatus:
      apiVersion: calico.networking.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
      kind: NetworkStatus
```

## How to start using or developing this extension controller locally

You can run the controller locally on your machine by executing `make start-networking-calico`. Please make sure to have the `kubeconfig` pointed to the cluster you want to connect to.
Static code checks and tests can be executed by running `VERIFY=true make all`. We are using Go modules for Golang package dependency management and [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo)/[Gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega) for testing.
